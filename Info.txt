Most weapon packs feature visible hands.
While this grants the pack a sense of identity, it proves to break immersion
when using a skin that doesn't match the hands shown.
(Using a female character skin with muscular Doomguy hands, for example.)
Because of this, I felt compelled to create a weapon pack that is as bare-bones
as possible when it comes to its identity.

Guidelines for sprite transformation:
-If sprite is too small, then multiply its size by either 1.25% or 1.50%.
-When displaying emphasis on rotating the weapon, increase sprite size by
10 pixels, and rotate sprite by 5 degrees.
